# YoutubeApi
Fast and dirty test of youtube api. 
The application upon start will request access to user's youtube account. By iterating through the user's playlists the app will update note of every playlist item.

The client-secret.json intentionally omitted. To generate one see the article https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/guide/aaa_oauth
